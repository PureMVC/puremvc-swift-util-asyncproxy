/**
A base `IAsyncProxy` implementation.

It allows the creator to associate data (a token)
and methods that should be called when a request is completed.

Your subclass should override the `asyncAction`
method where your domain logic will handle the async operation.
Must call super to set responder and the token.

Instantiate as a proxy, with or without a name. The async activity
is started by invoking the `asyncAction` method. There
cannot be more than one activity running per instance.
